Here's how the calculation works:

1:The values of the two input fields with the ids total_members 
and average_chapaties are retrieved using the document.getElementById()
method and stored in the variables total_members and average_chapaties.

2:The number of chapatis consumed by the entire family in a year
 is calculated by multiplying the number of members by the average
 number of chapatis each person eats per day, and then multiplying
 that value by 365. This result is stored in the variable 
total_chapaties_in_an_year.

3:The total weight of the chapatis is then calculated by multiplying
 total_chapaties_in_an_year by the average weight of a single
 chapati, which is assumed to be 60 grams. The result is stored
 in the variable total_chapaties_weight.

4:Finally, the total weight of wheat needed to make the chapatis
 is calculated by dividing total_chapaties_weight
 by 1000 (to convert grams to kilograms) and storing the
 result in the variable total_wheat.

5:The result of the calculation is then set as the value
 of the HTML input field with the id total_wheat by using the 
document.getElementById("total_wheat").value = total_wheat + "Kg"; statement.
